# Quite a bit text

This project side uses the famous [express](https://expressjs.com/)

I have a little more experience with the backend than the frontend, and I've worked with and built frameworks for many different APIs. I check everything on the postman. As a database I chose mongo db (mongoose), without any orms, just mongo.

There were no problems with creating a server, everything was done quickly enough, except for one thing. I wanted to create an error logger in the decorators, but ended up abandoning the idea due to the simplicity of the project.
