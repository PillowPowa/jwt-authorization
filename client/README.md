# Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# Quite a bit text

Before this I had experience with `react` but I didn't have enough experience with `html` and `css` so it caused some small difficulties which were not too hard to overcome, this project uses package dependencies like: `react`, `mobx`, `axios`. Admittedly, there are a few flaws in this project that I'd like to change, but suddenly I have ideas for other, bigger projects. Maybe I'll come back to this project and rework it a bit.

In general I liked this return to the frontend, I positioned myself more as a backend developer, but this moment changed things a bit. In addition to implementing various APIs, I decided to make a frontend.

This client didn't cause much difficulty (still a project for beginners :D), so I'd describe how the development went, but why, if everything here is simple and clear, even my friend without programming experience was able to "read" this project.
